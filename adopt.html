								<p>
						The first step towards adoption is filling out our adoption application below. Once the adoption application has been received and reviewed, we will reach out to you to answer any questions that we have as well as to potentially set up a meet-and-greet with the Viva! dog you have applied for. Since our goal is to find each dog their perfect match, there may be times that a meet-and-greet does not happen with the dog applied for. This usually happens because your home is not the right fit for the dog in question, but we are always willing to make suggestions on who might be a better fit.<br /><br />
 
We prefer to do meet-and-greets with you and your current dogs at a neutral location (e.g., a park) to see how everyone gets along. Doing this outside of your home limits any territorial issues and gives us a better idea of how your current pets will coexist with a new friend. 
 								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="adopt-steps">
							<div>2</div>
								<p>
									If the meet-and-greet goes well, the next step towards adoption is a home visit. This gives us the opportunity to look around and make sure that it is a safe environment for our dog. We will address any issues or concerns that we may have at this time. 
 								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="adopt-steps">
							<div>3</div>
								<p>
									If everyone agrees to pursue the adoption after a successful meet-and-greet, and home visit, we will do an adoption contract.  At this time, we will collect the adoption fee and take a Happy Tail photo. Our adoption contract includes a mandatory 10-day trial period to ensure that everyone feels this is a perfect match. Sometimes, a dog needs a little more than 10 days to truly settle in. We consider this on a case by case basis, and may extend this trial period if needed. 
								</p>
						</div>
						
					</div>				
					<div class="row">
							<p class="long-copy">
								Once the adoption is finalized, you're an official member of the Viva! family! We are just a phone call or email away to provide support, answer questions, or anything else you may need. We consider all of our adopted dogs and their families a part of ours, and we are here for you both throughout their lifetime. Our commitment to our dogs does not end at adoption.<br /><br />

One of our foster families witnessed this and coaxed him into their car. He is now living happily ever after with people who love him and would never throw him away.</span>
